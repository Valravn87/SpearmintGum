<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my web-site extolling the virtues of Wrigley's Spearmint Gum!  If you have never chewed a stick of that divine philter, you have sorely deprived yourself of one of life's great pleasures.  Be sure that you don't confuse it with Doublemint Gum, another product of the Wrigley's company.  Although good in its own right, only one gum can rule supreme, and that gum is Spearmint.  </p>

<p>Wrigley's Spearmint traces its origins back to 1893.  Therefore, when you chew this gum, you are chewing history.  It is ill-advised to chew 100-year-old gum, however.  That would be taking the notion of "history" a bit too literally.  Instead, treat yourself to some modern gum; Wrigley's currently offers its Spearmint Gum in four sizes:</p>
<ul>
<li>5-stick pack (the classic)</li>
<li>15-stick Slim Pack</li>
<li>4 pack (4 of the 5-stick packs in one)</li>
<li>Slim Pack 3 Pack (3 Slim Packs in one)</li>
</ul>

<p>The animation budget was not a high priority for the Wrigley company of the 1960's.  Excelling at the chewing gum game was and remains a high priority.</p>
<h3> The burning question... </h3>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/23gCTWWGhxw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>
<p>While Spearmint gum will not lose its flavor at the bedpost overnight, it will lose its flavor over time from chewing.  Used gum should be discarded and not saved for another time, at your bedpost or in your pocket or anywhere else.  Also, while a stick of gum might become a bit hard to bite on a frosty December morning, it should be no obstacle to chewing, given a bit of time to warm up in your mouth.</p>
<h3> About the author </h3>
<p>Corrado Arturo was born 1887 in Bologna, Italy.  He moved to America in 1913, where he spent several years peddling various and sundry potions and elixirs before finding his true calling in distributing Wrigley's Spearmint Gum, which he has been doing ever since.</p>

<p>With the tides of time come the winds of change; thus, the packaging design has shifted over the years.  Nevertheless, many aspects remain constant, such as the single-headed spear emblazoned with the word "Spearmint."</p>
<img src="images/cat.jpg" width="250px"><br>
<p>Dapper though this feline fellow may be, his breath must surely reek of whatever gourmet cat food he is wont to partake of.  Perhaps a stick of Wrigley's Spearmint could ameliorate his situation.*</p>
<p class="footnote">*Do not give Spearmint gum to your cat, unless specifically asked for.</p>
